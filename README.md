# Data Munging and Exploratory Data Analysis

Used for homework assignments for the Fall 2016 Data Science Master's program course "Data Munging and Exploratory Data Analysis" at New College of Florida. 

The goal of the course was to learn how to use the R programming language to clean datasets and answer questions about the data. All of the assignments were written using R Markdown.
